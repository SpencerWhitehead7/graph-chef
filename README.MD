# graph-chef

## What is this

graph-chef is an app / cookbook for storing and representing recipes as directed graphs to visualize the steps and flow of the recipe more easily and intuitively than a conventional set of directions.

## Dynamic app

The dynamic app is a fully featured React CRUD app backed by Firebase. It supports recipes, user accounts, search, and creation/editing.

## Static site

The static site is a digital cookbook built with Astro and several other FE technologies. It supports recipes and search, but not creation or editing because it has no backend; the underlying files are baked out into a static site at build time.
